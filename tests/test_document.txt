Chewbacca, also known as Chewie, is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, portrayed by Peter Mayhew.  Chewbacca's creation as a "gentle, hairy, non-English-speaking-co-pilot" was inspired by George Lucas seeing his own dog sitting up on the passenger seat of his car.  The dog, named Indiana, also inspired the name of the lead character in another one of Lucas' film franchises - Indiana Jones.  It is said that Chewbacca's name is derived from sobaka, the Russian word for dog.  Chewbacca, a Wookie, became Han Solo's first mate and companion after Solo, then an Imperial Captain, refused an order to kill him while Chewbacca was a slave of the Empire.  Solo was dismissed from the Imperial Navy for disobedience and became a smuggler.  Chewbacca owed a life debt to Han and would protect Han Solo for the rest of his life.  Chewbacca was named one of the "greatest sidekicks" in film history by Entertainment Weekly.  In all four screen appearances, Chewbacca was played by Peter Mayhew, who was chosen for his height -- 7'3" (2.2 m).  Five identical costumes were made for Mayhew to wear.  In the three original films and a holiday special, the suits were mad of yak hair and mohair.  For Revenge of the Sith, the suit was made of more comfortable materials, though Mayhew's filming only lasted for a day.  Only Mayhew's blue eyes could be seen in his costume, but fans easily recognize him by his distinctive gestures; his co-workers said they were able to tell when a stand-in was taking his place.
